- Automatic scans with Nessus and OpenVAS (unauthenticated and authenticated)
    - unauthenticated: Not much findings (just unsafe SSH MAC ciphers can be used / are enabled)
    - authenticated: Nessus more findings than OpenVAS
        - couple of exploits / POCs found (see Findings-Notes.md)
        - mostly kernel related (can be fixed by updating kernel)
    - LinPEAS (scan freezes when run just in memory (not installed))
- Manual investigation
    - Anapaya Appliance can be accessed + modified without authentication/password
    - Scan for open ports -> Mismatch between official docs and findings (see Findings-Notes.md)
    - Checked for running services
    - Docker investigation (with docker scout (nothing found) + trivy (some interesting things))
    - default user "anapaya" has sudo rights -> no prompt for password (configured as such in /etc/sudoers)
