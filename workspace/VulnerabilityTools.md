Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning tool. It helps identify security vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications. Nessus scans for known vulnerabilities and provides detailed reports on the findings.

To use Nessus, you typically install it on a dedicated server or virtual machine. Once installed, you can configure it to scan specific IP ranges, hosts, or network segments. Nessus uses a database of known vulnerabilities and performs various tests to identify potential weaknesses.

The results of a Nessus scan include a list of vulnerabilities, their severity levels, and recommendations for remediation. Nessus also provides detailed information about each vulnerability, including its description, impact, and potential solutions.


# OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)

Free / Open Source (https://github.com/greenbone/openvas-scanner)
Scanner part of Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM)

Kali Linux Install Guide (https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/kali/index.html)

Web interface: https://127.0.0.1:9392


OpenVAS, which stands for Open Vulnerability Assessment System, is a full-featured vulnerability scanner. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans and a powerful internal programming language to implement any type of vulnerability test.

The scanner develops a continuously updated and detailed 'Network Vulnerability Tests' (NVT) feed. This feed can help users stay aware of the latest vulnerabilities and threats in their systems.

OpenVAS is free software and is a part of the GNU General Public License (GPL). It's a very popular tool among security auditors and penetration testers to evaluate the security defenses of their systems.


# OpenSCAP (say: open s-cap)

Only for local system -> can use oscap-ssh tool for remote systems (needs OpenSCAP to be installed)

Can scan Docker containers or VMs

Free / Open Source (https://www.open-scap.org/download/)
OpenSCAP Base (CLI tool) -> up to date on GitHub
OpenSCAP Workbench (GUI tool) -> Version still from 2020 on GitHub

Always needs a content to test against: Provided by: scap-security-guide SSG

Scan Types: 
- XCCDF Scan: XCCDF (eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) scans evaluate the system's compliance against rules defined in XCCDF files. These rules are expressed in the form of checks that verify configurations, settings, and security measures.
- OVAL Scan: OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) scans focus on detecting vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the system by checking for known software flaws, missing patches, or misconfigurations.
- DataStream Scan: DataStream scans utilize SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) DataStream files, which contain XCCDF, OVAL, and other relevant security content. This type of scan provides a comprehensive evaluation of system compliance and vulnerability status.




OpenSCAP is an open-source framework for Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). SCAP is a line of standards managed by NIST with the aim of providing a standardized approach to maintaining the security of systems, such as automatically verifying the presence of patches, checking system security configuration settings, and examining systems for signs of compromise.

The OpenSCAP project provides a wide variety of tools to assist administrators and auditors with assessment, measurement, and enforcement of security baselines. It includes a library for parsing and evaluating each component in the SCAP suite.


# InsightVM (Rapid7)

InsightVM is a vulnerability management solution developed by Rapid7. It provides real-time visibility into the risk across your environment, helping organizations understand and prioritize vulnerabilities. InsightVM uses attacker analytics to model which vulnerabilities are most likely to be used in real-world attacks. It also integrates with existing IT workflows for faster remediation. Additionally, InsightVM can assess container images and cloud configurations for vulnerabilities, ensuring a secure build process and cloud environment. Customizable dashboards and reports in InsightVM help track progress and maintain visibility for stakeholders. It's part of Rapid7's Insight cloud, which offers a range of security solutions.
