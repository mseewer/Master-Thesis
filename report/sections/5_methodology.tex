In the service offer to armasuisse, SWITCH explicitly states that the
existing IP connection and the new SCION connection are physically separated.
Sunrise and Swisscom guarantee access to their internet backbone without further
details on the connection. Sunrise provided the most details about the service
offering. In ZÃ¼rich and Thun, the SCION links are connected to Cisco routers on
site, from where they are connected to the appliance, taking a total of 2 standard
height units of rack space. This is the standard deployment of SCION services
provided by SWITCH and Swisscom.
