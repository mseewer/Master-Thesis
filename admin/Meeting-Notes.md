# Notes Master Thesis Meetings

## 04.03.24
TODOs:
- Select topic / focus -> read test concept
- read into related work (BGP, Attacker models) + make notes


## 12.03.24
DONE:
- Test concept
  - contains network setup
  - What about Anapaya Core / Gate devices? -> No (root) Access?
    - What are different devices types? Edge, Core, Gate

Focus (in order of preference):
- test Anapaya devices + its software/configuration (LinPEAS?)
- Computational DDos Attacks
- routing + path discovery mechanism (malicious AS -> can create valid-looking signature, but wrong path) -> access to 2 ISD (Estonia?)
- traffic sniffing -> privacy? fingerprinting?
- Malformed packets (-> fuzzing -> previous work?)
- Volumetric DDoS attacks (-> COLIBRI)
- (PKI -> quick check, uses ecdsa + SHA2)

TODOs:

- Edge device (Nessus + OpenSoucre)
  - test softwware + config
  - Computational DDoS Attacks (SCION + others)
- Vulnerability tools (OpenVAS (Greenbone) -> test version = enterprise trial version)
- nmap
- look at anapaya docs
- presentation duration 15 min

## 19.03.24
- https://www.greenbone.net/en/testnow/ -> enterprise trial version
  - By default, the Greenbone Enterprise TRIAL uses the Greenbone Community Feed instead of the more comprehensive Greenbone Enterprise Feed.
